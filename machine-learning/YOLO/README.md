Creating a real-time YOLO algorithm for detecting certain body movements on humans when exercising with weights involves the following steps:

    Collect and prepare the dataset: Gather videos of people exercising with weights, performing the specific body movements you want to detect. Label the videos with bounding boxes around the body parts involved in the movements and assign class labels to each bounding box.
    Install dependencies: Ensure you have TensorFlow 2.x and other required libraries installed on your Linux computer or Raspberry Pi.
    Choose a YOLO variant: Select a YOLO variant suitable for your hardware, such as YOLOv3 or YOLOv4. You may need to use a lighter version of the model, like YOLOv3-tiny or YOLOv4-tiny, for better performance on a Raspberry Pi.
    Train the YOLO model: Train the YOLO model on your labeled dataset. You can use transfer learning by starting with a pre-trained YOLO model and fine-tuning it on your dataset.
    Test the model: Test the trained model on new, unseen videos to evaluate its performance.
    Deploy the model: Deploy the trained model on your Linux computer or Raspberry Pi with Google Coral AI for real-time object detection.
